There several ways that you can try to install python on VS.
1.Before installing VisualStudio on your computer,click the Python Developing,then the installer
	will install the components for Python.
2.If you have a pre-installed VisualStudio,try to start a new project,there is no python project,
  but you can find that there is an option "Open VisualStudio Installer",click it,then Install the
  Python components just like above.

Before going:
	why I learn Python?because I have nothing to do except for working.I have to find something interasting.
	Python is just a try.
